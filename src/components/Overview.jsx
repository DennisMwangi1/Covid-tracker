The corona virus is a family of viruses that cause respiratory illnesses such as pneumonia, bronchitis and death in human beings.These viruses are typically spread through the air by contact with respiratory secretions,such as saliva and blood. Globally, as of 6.06 pm CET ,21ST march 2023, there have been 761,071,826 confirmed cases of the above virus , including 6,879,677 deaths reported to the world health organization ,not only does the organization give an overview of confirmed cases and deaths but it also gives an insight of 13,260,401,200 vaccine doses that have been administered.
Vaccines are the most critical tool needed to end the pandemic therefore equitable access to safe and effective vaccines is crucial.They are given as a shot in the muscle of the upper arm or in the thigh .
some of the vaccines advocated are as follows;
Pfizer-BioTech and Morderna covid-19 vaccines (mRNA vaccinnes).
Johnson&johnsonâ€™s Janssen covid-19 vaccine (viral vector vaccine).
Novavax Covid-19 vaccines(protein subunit vaccine).
  Mrna vaccines
They use (mRNA) created in the laboratory to teach the cells how to make a protein .The Mrna from the vaccines is broken down within a few days after vaccination and discarded from the body.
Viral vector vaccines
These vaccines use a harmless,modified version of a different virus(a vector virus).its function is to deliver instructions to the cells on how to recognize and fight the virus that causes Covid-19.
Protein subunit vaccines
They contain pieces(proteins) of the virus that causes Covid 19.The virus pieces are the spike protein, after learning how to respond to the spike protein the immune system responds quickly to the actual virus spike protein and protect on from Covid 19.
It is important to practice respiratory etiquette, for example by coughing into a flexed elbow and self isolate until one recovers.The World Health Organization is set to maintain the momentum of increasing access to covid 19 vaccines and with furthermore continue to support countries in accelerating vaccine delivery to save lives .The covid 19 tracker illustatrates and gives statitistics of the above virus .
